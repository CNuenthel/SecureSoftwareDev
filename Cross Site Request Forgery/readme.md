### Steps:
    Create a Flask web app that allows a user to change their email.
    The form submission will be vulnerable because it doesn't use CSRF protection.
    You'll then craft a malicious HTML page to exploit the vulnerability.


### How to Test:
Run app.py with python app.py.
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser and manually change the email.
Open exploit.html in your browser. The CSRF attack will automatically submit the form.
Check the Flask app logsâ€”you should see that the email has been changed without user interaction.
